## 🚀 Running Tests

### Quick Development Testing
```bash
# Run basic unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run unit + integration tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/ -v

# Run only fast tests
uv run pytest -k "not functional" -v
```

### Full Validation
```bash
# Run all tests (requires API credentials for functional tests)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
python tests/run_tests.py all

# Generate HTML report
uv run pytest --html=test_report.html --self-contained-html
```

### Test Categories
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, no external deps)
python tests/run_tests.py unit

# Integration tests (component interaction)
python tests/run_tests.py integration

# Functional tests (real API calls)
python tests/run_tests.py functional

# Quick test (unit + integration)
python tests/run_tests.py quick
```

- Mock SDK tests require fallback implementation
- These tests are skipped when SDK is unavailable

### Functional Tests Require API Credentials
- Real research workflow tests need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Web search integration requires internet connectivity
- These tests are designed for production validation

### Mock vs Real Behavior
- Mock SDK provides simulated responses
- Real API behavior may differ slightly
- Functional tests bridge this gap
