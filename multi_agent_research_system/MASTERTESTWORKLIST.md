- **Gap Research Decision Engine**: `Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument 'thresholds'`
- **Editorial Workflow Integrator**: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'HIGH'`

**Root Cause**: Logger configuration incompatibility in testing environment
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Does not prevent core functionality
**Follow-up Action**: Fix logger configuration or add logger fallbacks for testing

#### 🔧 Component Method Issues (0/6 methods found)
**Issue**: Method names don't match test expectations

- **Editorial Recommendations Engine**: Missing `generate_editorial_recommendations`, `prioritize_recommendations`, `create_implementation_plan`
- **Sub-Session Manager**: Missing `coordinate_gap_research`, `integrate_sub_session_results`

**Root Cause**: Method naming inconsistencies between actual implementation and test expectations
**Priority**: LOW - Core components load, methods exist but with different names
**Follow-up Action**: Either rename methods or update test expectations to match actual implementation

#### 🔧 Data Structure Issues
**Issue**: Missing some data structure classes
