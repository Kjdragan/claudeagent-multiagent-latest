## Core Implementation Patterns

### Async-First Architecture
```python
# All crawling operations follow async patterns
async def crawl_with_escalation(url: str, max_level: int = 3) -> CrawlResult:
    escalator = AntiBotEscalator()
    return await escalator.attempt_crawl(url, max_level)
```

### AI-Enhanced Content Processing
```python
# Intelligent content cleaning with optimization
async def clean_content_optimized(content: str, url: str) -> dict:
    # First assess if cleaning is needed
    is_clean, score = await assess_content_cleanliness(content, url)
    if is_clean:
        return {"content": content, "cleaned": False}

    # Apply AI cleaning only when necessary
    return await clean_with_ai(content, url)
```

### Progressive Retry Logic
```python
# Smart retry with escalation
async def crawl_with_retry(url: str, session_id: str = None) -> CrawlResult:
    tracker = get_url_tracker()

    for level in range(4):  # 0-3 escalation levels
        if tracker.should_retry(url, level):
            result = await crawl_with_anti_bot(url, level)
            tracker.record_attempt(url, result, level)
            if result.success:
                return result

    return CrawlResult(url, False, error="All escalation levels failed")
```

### Intelligent Search Strategy Selection
```python
# AI-driven search strategy selection
def select_optimal_strategy(query: str) -> StrategyAnalysis:
    selector = SearchStrategySelector()
    return selector.analyze_and_recommend(query)
```

## Working Components

### 1. Search and Crawl Integration (`z_search_crawl_utils.py`)

The main workhorse utility that integrates search, crawling, and cleaning:

```python
async def search_crawl_and_clean_direct(
    query: str,
    search_type: str = "search",
    num_results: int = 15,
    auto_crawl_top: int = 10,
    crawl_threshold: float = 0.3,
    max_concurrent: int = None,
    session_id: str = "default",
    anti_bot_level: int = 1,
    workproduct_dir: str = None,
    workproduct_prefix: str = ""
) -> str:
    """
    Combined search, crawl, and clean operation with URL replacement mechanism

    Key Features:
    - SERP API integration with 15-25 results per query
    - URL selection with relevance scoring and deduplication
    - Parallel crawling with progressive anti-bot escalation
    - Immediate content cleaning after each scrape
    - URL replacement for permanently blocked domains
    - Workproduct generation with standardized naming
    """
```

### 2. Anti-Bot Escalation System (`anti_bot_escalation.py`)

Sophisticated 4-level progressive anti-bot system:

```python
class AntiBotEscalationManager:
    """
    Progressive anti-bot escalation system with smart retry logic

    Features:
    - Level 0: Basic crawling with standard headers
    - Level 1: Enhanced headers + JavaScript rendering
    - Level 2: Advanced proxy rotation + browser automation
    - Level 3: Stealth mode with full browser simulation
    - Automatic learning from difficult sites
    - Domain-specific escalation patterns
    """

    async def crawl_with_escalation(self, url: str, initial_level: int = 0, max_level: int = 3) -> EscalationResult:
        """Crawl URL with progressive anti-bot escalation"""
```

**Anti-Bot Level Configurations:**
- **Level 0 (Basic)**: Standard headers, no JavaScript, 30s timeout
- **Level 1 (Enhanced)**: Enhanced headers, JavaScript rendering, 30s timeout
- **Level 2 (Advanced)**: Advanced headers, proxy rotation, 45s timeout
- **Level 3 (Stealth)**: Stealth mode, full browser simulation, 60s timeout

### 3. Content Cleaning Pipeline (`content_cleaning.py`)

AI-powered content cleaning with GPT-5-nano integration:

```python
async def clean_content_with_gpt5_nano(content: str, url: str, search_query: str = None) -> str:
    """
    Use GPT-5-nano to intelligently clean extracted content

    Features:
    - Removes navigation, ads, and irrelevant content
    - Preserves main article content relevant to search query
    - Handles technical content with code preservation
    - Quality assessment and optimization
    """

async def assess_content_cleanliness(content: str, url: str, threshold: float = 0.7) -> tuple[bool, float]:
    """
    Quickly assess if content is clean enough to use without full cleaning

    Returns:
        (is_clean_enough: bool, cleanliness_score: float)
    """
```

### 4. URL Replacement Mechanism

Handles permanently blocked domains through intelligent replacement:

```python
# URL replacement logic in search_crawl_and_clean_direct
async def process_url_with_replacement(url: str, is_replacement: bool = False):
    """Process URL with automatic replacement for permanently blocked domains"""

    # If permanently blocked (Level 4), attempt replacement
    if not result["success"] and result["scrape_result"].final_level == 4:
        replacement_url = get_next_replacement_url()
        if replacement_url:
            replacement_result = await process_url_with_replacement(replacement_url, is_replacement=True)
            return replacement_result
```

### 5. Search Strategy Selection (`search_strategy_selector.py`)

AI-driven search strategy optimization:

```python
class SearchStrategySelector:
    """
    AI-driven search strategy selection based on query analysis

    Strategies:
    - Google Search: For general queries with broad coverage needs
    - SERP News: For time-sensitive and news-related queries
    - Hybrid: Combination approach for comprehensive coverage
    """

    def analyze_and_recommend(self, query: str) -> StrategyAnalysis:
        """Analyze query and recommend optimal search strategy"""
```

### 6. Performance Optimization

#### Media Optimization (3-4x Performance Improvement)
```python
# Recommended configuration for text-only research
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    text_mode=True,                    # Disable images and heavy content

    exclude_external_images=True,      # Block external domain images
    light_mode=True,                   # Disable background features
    wait_for="body",                   # Faster than domcontentloaded
    page_timeout=20000                 # Shorter timeout for better responsiveness
)
```

#### Anti-Bot Performance Tracking
```python
# Performance monitoring and optimization
def get_escalation_stats() -> dict:
    """Get comprehensive anti-bot performance statistics"""
    return {
        "total_attempts": self.stats.total_attempts,
        "successful_crawls": self.stats.successful_crawls,
        "overall_success_rate": success_rate,

from utils.z_search_crawl_utils import search_crawl_and_clean_direct
# ... your code here
"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Crawling Failures
```python
# Symptom: High failure rates
# Solution: Check anti-bot escalation logs
escalator = get_escalation_manager()
escalation_stats = escalator.get_stats()
print(f"Most used level: {escalation_stats['level_success_rates']}")
print(f"Success rate by level: {escalation_stats['level_success_rates']}")
```

#### Content Quality Issues
```python
# Symptom: Poor content extraction
# Solution: Check cleanliness assessment and cleaning logs
from utils.content_cleaning import assess_content_cleanliness

is_clean, score = await assess_content_cleanliness(content, url)
if not is_clean:
    print(f"Content needs cleaning (score: {score})")
    # Review AI cleaning effectiveness
```

#### Performance Bottlenecks
```python
# Symptom: Slow processing
# Solution: Enable media optimization
from utils.crawl4ai_media_optimized import MediaOptimizedCrawler

crawler = MediaOptimizedCrawler()
# 3-4x performance improvement with media exclusion
optimized_config = crawler.get_optimized_config()
```

#### Search Strategy Issues
```python
# Symptom: Ineffective search results
# Solution: Analyze strategy selection effectiveness
from utils.search_strategy_selector import SearchStrategySelector

selector = SearchStrategySelector()
strategy_stats = selector.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Strategy effectiveness: {strategy_stats}")
```

#### URL Replacement Issues
```python
# Symptom: Many permanently blocked domains
# Solution: Check replacement URL pool and effectiveness
# URL replacement is automatic, but you can monitor its effectiveness
# by checking the replacement_stats in search results
```

### Debug Mode Activation
```bash
# Enable comprehensive debugging
export UTILS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export DEBUG_CRAWLING=true
export ANTI_BOT_DEBUG=true

# Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f /path/to/logs/utils.log
```
