# Agents Directory - Multi-Agent Research System

This directory contains the actual agent implementations for the multi-agent research system. The agents are a mix of template-based implementations with limited AI reasoning and some advanced components with theoretical capabilities that are not fully integrated into the working system.

## Directory Purpose

The agents directory provides a set of specialized AI agents that coordinate through the multi-agent research system to deliver research outputs. The system has both functional working agents and advanced theoretical frameworks that exist alongside the basic implementation.

## System Architecture Reality

The current agent system contains multiple layers of implementation:

### Working Layer (Functional)
- **Template-Based Agents**: Basic agents with predefined response patterns
- **AI-Powered Components**: GPT-5-nano integration for content cleaning and quality assessment
- **Session Management**: Working session-based file organization and tracking

### Enhanced Layer (Theoretical/Partial)
- **Advanced Editorial Engine**: Sophisticated decision-making framework with limited integration
- **Gap Research System**: Complex gap analysis with minimal actual execution
- **Enhanced Agent Framework**: Comprehensive SDK integration with enterprise features (mostly theoretical)

### Actual Agent Implementation Analysis

## Working Agents (Functional Implementation)

### Research Agent (`research_agent.py`)

**File Size**: 371 lines

**Actual Implementation**: Template-based research coordination without real web search capabilities

```python
# Real Implementation Pattern
async def web_research(self, args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Conduct comprehensive web research on a specified topic."""

    # This would integrate with WebSearch tool in actual implementation
    # For now, return a structured response that would come from research
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Research conducted on: {topic}\n\nDepth: {research_depth}\nFocus areas: {focus_areas}\n\n[Research results would be populated here from actual web search and analysis]"
        }],
        "research_data": {
            "topic": topic,
            "status": "completed",
            "findings_count": 0,  # Would be populated from actual research
            "sources_count": 0,    # Would be populated from actual research
            "confidence_score": 0.0  # Would be calculated from research quality
        }
    }
```

**Real Capabilities**:

**Actual Implementation**: Advanced framework with real search tool integration intentions but mock implementation

```python
# Real Implementation Pattern
async def real_web_research(self, args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Conduct comprehensive web research using real search tools."""

    # Choose the appropriate search tool based on research requirements
    if search_type == "news" and research_depth in ["comprehensive", "deep"]:
        search_tool = "enhanced_news_search"
    elif research_depth in ["comprehensive", "deep"]:
        search_tool = "expanded_query_search_and_extract"
    else:
        search_tool = "enhanced_search_scrape_clean"

    # This would be called through the MCP system in actual implementation
    # For now, we'll simulate the structure of what would be returned
    mock_search_result = f"""
# Enhanced Search Results: {topic}

```python
# Real Implementation Pattern
async def create_report(self, args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate a structured report from research data."""

    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Report generated based on research data\nFormat: {report_format}\nAudience: {target_audience}"

            "status": "completed"
        }
    }
```

**Real Capabilities**:
- ✅ Query intent analysis (basic implementation)
- ✅ Format-specific report generation
- ✅ Session-based file management
