## Session Overview

**Session ID**: f34d5a30-df2f-4b3b-b468-1b332ce58386
**Research Topic**: Recent information about the spreading of measles in the US
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Session Duration**: Multi-stage research and analysis process

This multi-agent research session produced a comprehensive analysis of the 2025 measles outbreak in the United States, representing the most significant measles resurgence in 33 years. The research workflow progressed through four distinct stages, each building upon previous work to create increasingly refined and accurate reports.

## Key Research Findings

### Critical Public Health Situation
- **Historical Significance**: 2025 marks the highest measles case count since 1992, with 1,288-1,500+ confirmed cases nationwide
- **Elimination Status Reversal**: First time since 2000 elimination declaration that cases reached current levels
- **Geographic Scope**: Cases reported across 39 states, representing widespread national impact

### Major Outbreak Centers
1. **Texas**: Largest outbreak with 762 cases, now declared ended but with lasting impact
2. **Minnesota**: Currently experiencing rapid case increases
3. **New Mexico**: Outbreak linked to Texas cases
4. **West Texas**: 250+ cases resulted in 2 confirmed deaths (including unvaccinated child)
5. **Georgia**: Successfully contained small outbreak with coordinated response

### Contributing Factors
- **Vaccination Coverage Gaps**: Only 92.5% of kindergartners received recommended 2-shot MMR series in 2024-25
- **Increased Exemptions**: CDC reported increased childhood vaccine exemptions during 2024-2025 school year
- **International Travel**: Cross-border transmission contributing to spread
