   - Agent definitions loaded (4 agents: research, report, editor, ui_coordinator)
   - Agent loggers initialized

2. **MCP Server Configuration** (1-2 seconds)
   - Research Tools Server setup with 7 tools
   - API key validation (SERP_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY confirmed)

3. **Client Creation** (1-2 seconds)
   - Single multi-agent client connection
   - Natural language agent selection enabled

4. **Session Directory Setup** (instant)
   - UUID-based session directory creation
   - KEVIN directory structure established

5. **Health Verification** (5-7 seconds)
   - 4/4 agent health checks
   - Tool verification (SERP search, file operations)
   - System readiness confirmation

### **Research Workflow Execution**

**Stage Progression** (consistent across all sessions):
1. **Initialization** → **Research** (2-4 minutes)
2. **Research** → **Report Generation** (3-5 minutes)
3. **Report Generation** → **Editorial Review** (1-2 minutes)
4. **Editorial Review** → **Finalization** (1-2 minutes)

**Total Session Duration**: 7-13 minutes (average 10 minutes)
