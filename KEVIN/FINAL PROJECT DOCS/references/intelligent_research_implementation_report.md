## Technical Architecture

### Core Intelligence Components

**Enhanced Relevance Scoring Algorithm** (Copied from z-playground1)
```python
final_score = (
    position_score * 0.40 +      # Google position weight
    title_score * 0.30 +          # Query term matching in title
    snippet_score * 0.30           # Query term matching in snippet
)
```

**Threshold-Based URL Selection** (Copied from z-playground1)
- Search 15 URLs with redundancy for expected failures
- Filter by relevance threshold (default 0.3)
- Sort by relevance score (highest first)
- Select up to configured limit for parallel processing

**Multi-Stage Content Compression**
```python
# Level 1: High Priority (Full detail) - Top 3 sources
# Level 2: Medium Priority (Summarized) - Next 3 sources
# Level 3: Low Priority (References only) - Remaining sources
```
