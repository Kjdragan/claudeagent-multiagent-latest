## Executive Overview

This document defines the optimal workflow for processing user research queries through the multi-agent research system. The workflow is designed to maximize research quality, comprehensiveness, and efficiency through intelligent query reformulation, parallel processing, advanced content ranking, and multi-stage quality enhancement.

**Core Philosophy**: Transform a simple user query into a comprehensive, multi-perspective research report through intelligent expansion, parallel execution, and iterative quality enhancement.

---

## 1. Query Processing & Enhancement Stage

### 1.1 User Query Intake and Analysis
**Input**: Raw user query (e.g., "latest news from the Russia Ukraine war")

**Process**:
1. **Query Intent Analysis**: Analyze user intent, scope, and requirements
   - Identify temporal scope (latest news, historical analysis, trends)
   - Determine depth requirements (overview, comprehensive analysis, detailed investigation)
   - Assess target audience (general, academic, technical, policy)
   - Extract key entities and concepts

2. **Requirement Specification**: Define research parameters
   - **Depth**: Standard Research / Comprehensive Analysis / Deep Investigation
   - **Audience**: General / Academic / Technical / Policy / Business
   - **Format**: Briefing / Detailed Report / Academic Paper / Executive Summary
   - **Time Sensitivity**: Breaking News / Recent Developments / Historical Analysis

3. **Session Initialization**: Create comprehensive session context
   - Generate unique session ID
   - Initialize session metadata and tracking
   - Set up directory structure and logging
   - Establish quality thresholds and success criteria

### 1.2 Intelligent Query Reformulation
**Goal**: Transform user query into optimal search queries using LLM intelligence

**Process**:
1. **Original Query Enhancement**: Reformulate user query for optimal search results
   ```
   Input: "latest news from the Russia Ukraine war"
   Enhanced: "Russia Ukraine war latest developments October 2025 military updates civilian impacts international response"
   ```

2. **Orthogonal Query Generation**: Create two complementary queries from different perspectives
   - **Temporal Query**: Focus on recent developments and timeline
     ```
     "Russia Ukraine war timeline October 2025 recent attacks casualties territorial changes"
     ```
   - **Thematic Query**: Focus on specific themes or aspects
     ```
     "Ukraine war international diplomacy NATO involvement economic sanctions humanitarian crisis 2025"
     ```

3. **Query Optimization**: Apply search optimization techniques
   - Add relevant date ranges and time modifiers
   - Include geographic and entity specifications
   - Incorporate domain-specific terminology
   - Balance specificity vs. comprehensiveness

**Output**: Three optimized search queries ready for parallel execution
