# Salient Points & Workproduct Optimization Implementation Plan

## Overview
Enhancing the workproduct system to provide report agents with rich metadata (including 300-word salient points) to prevent hallucination and enable intelligent article selection.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (ALL PHASES)

### **Phase 1: Model Configuration ✅**

**Changed:** All OpenAI model references from `gpt-4o-mini` → `gpt-5-nano`

**Files Modified:**
- `utils/query_enhancer.py`
  - Line 50: `__init__(self, model: str = "gpt-5-nano")`
  - Line 317: `get_query_enhancer(model: str = "gpt-5-nano")`

**Status:** ✅ All query expansion now uses gpt-5-nano (cheaper, faster)

---

### **Phase 2: Scraping Target Configuration ✅**

**Problem:** System was targeting "successful scrapes" not "successful cleans". Scrapes can succeed but yield spam/garbage that fails cleaning.

**Solution:** Target successful_cleans with 2x multiplier for scrape attempts

**Files Modified:**
- `config/settings.py`
  - Line 47: `target_successful_cleans: int = 10` (was target_successful_scrapes = 15)
  - Line 48: `scrape_attempt_multiplier: float = 2.0` (NEW)
  - Lines 55-58: Added `@property max_scrape_attempts` calculator
  - Lines 238-244: Updated DefaultSettings

**Configuration:**
```python
target_successful_cleans = 10  # Goal: 10 clean articles
scrape_attempt_multiplier = 2.0  # Attempt 20 scrapes to get 10 cleans
max_scrape_attempts = target_successful_cleans * multiplier = 20
```

**Status:** ✅ Configuration is parameter-driven, not hardcoded

---

### **Phase 3: Content Cleaning with Salient Points ✅**

**Added:** `salient_points` field to cleaning output - 300-word bullet summary of key facts/themes

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/content_cleaner_agent.py`
  - Line 79: Added `salient_points: str = ""` to `CleanedContent` dataclass
  - Line 104: Added `salient_points: str` to `CleanedContentOutput` schema
  - Line 339: Pass salient_points from LLM output to CleanedContent
  - Lines 220, 282, 402, 595: Added salient_points="" to all fallback/error returns
  - Lines 687, 754-769: Updated prompts with salient_points requirements

**Prompt Instructions (Lines 754-769):**
```
SALIENT POINTS REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
Generate a ~300-word summary in bullet format that captures SPECIFIC, INTERESTING information:
• Focus on concrete facts, statistics, dates, numbers
• Main themes and arguments (not generic summary)
• Notable quotes or expert opinions
• Unique insights specific to this article
• DO NOT write generic summaries - be specific and factual

Example good: "• Trump brokered ceasefire with 20 living hostages released on October 13, 2025..."
Example bad: "• Article discusses recent developments..."
```

**Status:** ✅ LLM (gpt-5-nano) now generates salient_points for every cleaned article

---

### **Phase 3.5: Early Cutoff Optimization ✅**

**Added:** Dynamic scraping with early cutoff based on successful_scrapes threshold

**Configuration:**
```python
target_successful_cleans = 10
scrape_attempt_multiplier = 2.0  # Attempt 20 scrapes
early_cutoff_multiplier = 1.25   # Stop at 13 successful scrapes
```

**Files Modified:**
- `config/settings.py`
  - Line 49: Added `early_cutoff_multiplier`
  - Lines 62-65: Added `early_cutoff_threshold` property (rounds up)
- `utils/z_search_crawl_utils.py`
  - Lines 796-856: Replaced `asyncio.gather` with dynamic monitoring
  - Real-time tracking of successful_scrapes
  - Immediate task cancellation when threshold reached
  - Lines 970-980: Post-cleaning check and potential additional scraping logic

**Status:** ✅ Early cutoff triggers at 13 scrapes, saves time, logs metrics

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 4-5)

### **Phase 4: Merge Salient Points into Session State ✅**

**Implemented:** Session state builder with enriched metadata including salient_points

**Session State Structure (Implemented):**
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "search_metadata": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "title": "Trump brokers Gaza peace deal",
      "url": "https://...",
      "source": "BBC News",
      "date": "2025-10-15",
      "snippet": "President Trump announces...",  // From SERPER
      "relevance_score": 0.79,
      "has_full_content": true,  // Was successfully scraped & cleaned
      "salient_points": "• Trump brokered ceasefire, 20 hostages released Oct 13\n• Exchange: 250 prisoners..."
    }
  ],
  "scraped_articles": {
    "1": {
      "cleaned_content": "Full article text...",
      "word_count": 1500,
      "quality_score": 85,
      "relevance_score": 0.79,
      "cleaned_at": "2025-10-17T11:22:00"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_articles": 20,
    "articles_with_full_content": 10,
    "last_updated": "2025-10-17T11:22:00"
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `utils/z_search_crawl_utils.py`
  - Lines 982-992: Call `_build_enriched_session_state()` after cleaning phase
  - Lines 1316-1376: New function `_build_enriched_session_state()` 
    - Iterates through search_results and matches with cleaned articles
    - Extracts salient_points from clean_result
    - Builds search_metadata array with has_full_content flags
    - Stores full articles in scraped_articles dict
  - Lines 1379-1396: New function `_save_session_state()`
    - Saves to `KEVIN/sessions/{session_id}/session_state.json`
    - Creates directory if needed

**Status:** ✅ Session state saved immediately after cleaning with salient_points

---

### **Phase 5: Dynamic Prompt Injection for Report Agent ✅**

**Implemented:** Educational context injection with salient points in report agent's first prompt

**Educational Context Format (Implemented):**
```
**RESEARCH EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT** (10 articles with summaries)

**Article 1: Trump brokers Gaza peace deal**
- Source: BBC News | Date: 2025-10-15 | Relevance: 0.89
- URL: https://...

• Trump brokered ceasefire, 20 hostages released Oct 13
• Exchange: 250 prisoners + 1,718 detainees
• 20-point peace plan signed at Egypt summit
...

**Full Articles Available**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

To read any full article, use: `mcp__workproduct__get_workproduct_article(session_id="abc123", index=N)`
```

**Files Modified:**
- `core/orchestrator.py`
  - Lines 1206-1262: New method `_build_educational_context()`
    - Loads session_state.json
    - Filters articles with has_full_content and salient_points
    - Formats educational context with metadata and salient points
    - Returns formatted string with available article indices
  - Lines 1264-1283: New method `_should_inject_context()`
    - Checks `_report_context_injected` flag in session state
    - Returns boolean for injection decision
  - Lines 1285-1309: New method `_mark_context_injected()`
    - Sets `_report_context_injected = True` in session_state.json
    - Persists flag to prevent re-injection
  - Lines 1330-1370: Modified `_execute_enhanced_report_agent_query()`
    - Calls `_build_educational_context()` and `_should_inject_context()`
    - Conditionally injects context in first prompt only
    - Subsequent invocations use base instructions without context
    - Logs injection status

**Injection Strategy:**
- **First invocation**: Full context injected (estimated ~4000 tokens for 10 articles with 300-word summaries)
  - **IMPORTANT**: No truncation applied - full context always delivered
  - Token count varies based on: number of articles, summary length, configuration
  - If more source results or different config → context grows accordingly
  - System adapts to actual content size without artificial caps
- **Subsequent invocations**: Base instructions only (no re-injection)
- **Flag persistence**: `_report_context_injected` stored in session_state.json
- **Benefit**: Agent gets rich context upfront, reducing hallucination

**Status:** ✅ Context injected once per session, agent can request full articles on demand

---

## Testing Plan

### **Test 1: Verify Salient Points Generation**
```bash
# Run a research session
python run_research.py "test topic"

# Check that cleaned articles have salient_points
# Look in agent logs for "salient_points" in clean_result
```

### **Test 2: Verify Session State Structure**
```bash
# After research completes, check session_state.json
cat KEVIN/sessions/<session_id>/session_state.json | jq '.search_metadata[0]'

# Should see: has_full_content, salient_points fields
```

### **Test 3: Verify Report Agent Context**
```bash
# Check orchestrator logs during report generation
# Should see "RESEARCH EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT" in prompt
# Should NOT see repeated context in subsequent turns
```
