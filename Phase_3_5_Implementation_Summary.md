#### 3. Advanced Integration Capabilities

**Enhanced Sub-Session Result Integration**:
```python
async def integrate_sub_session_results(self, parent_session_id: str, integration_data: dict) -> dict:
    """Enhanced sub-session result integration with quality tracking and compliance analysis"""

    # Quality analysis integration
    quality_analysis = integration_data.get("quality_analysis", [])

    # Compliance analysis integration
    compliance_analysis = integration_data.get("compliance_analysis", [])

    # Enhanced integration quality calculation
    integration_content = {
        "quality_analysis": quality_analysis,
        "compliance_analysis": compliance_analysis,
        "integration_quality": self._calculate_integration_quality(quality_analysis),
        "enhanced_integration": True
    }

    return {
        "parent_session_id": parent_session_id,
        "integration_content": integration_content,
        "integration_quality": await self._calculate_enhanced_integration_quality(quality_analysis, compliance_analysis),
        "sub_session_count": len(integration_data.get("sub_sessions", [])),
        "successful_integrations": len([item for item in quality_analysis if item.get("status") == "completed"])
    }
```
